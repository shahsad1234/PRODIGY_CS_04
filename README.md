# Simple Keylogger

## Overview
The **Simple Keylogger** is a Python GUI application created using `tkinter`. It logs keystrokes entered within the application window, displaying them in a text area and saving them to a log file (`keylog.txt`). The program captures standard and special keys, and it supports Shift and Caps Lock for case handling.

**Please Note**: This program is intended for educational and ethical uses only.

## Features
- **Keystroke Logging**: Logs all keystrokes entered within the app, including special keys like Space, Enter, Tab, Backspace, and Escape.
- **Real-Time Display**: Displays keystrokes in the application's text area as they are entered.
